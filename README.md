#LINEAR REGRESSION WITH ONE VARIABLE


In this i have implemented linear regression with one variable to predict proﬁts for a food truck. 
Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering diﬀerent cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for proﬁts and populations from the cities.
You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next. The ﬁle ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The ﬁrst column is the population of a city and the second column is the proﬁt of a food truck in that city. A negative value for proﬁt indicates a loss. 
The ex1.m script has already been set up to load this data for you.

#LINEAR REGRESSION WITH MULTIPLE VARIABLE




In this part, you will implement linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses. Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to ﬁrst collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices. The ﬁle ex1data2.txt contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon. The ﬁrst column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house. The ex1 multi.m script has been set up to help you step through this exercise.
